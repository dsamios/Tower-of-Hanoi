# Tower Of Hanoi
Implementation of the famous puzzle "Tower of Hanoi" in Unity 2019 (C#)

# History
The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower,[1] and sometimes pluralised) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

Rules:
 - Only one disk must be moved at a time.
 - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
 - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
